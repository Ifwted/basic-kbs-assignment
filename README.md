# Basic Knowledge-Based System (KBS)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Knowledge-Based System (KBS) implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The system stores facts, applies logical rules, and infers new knowledge automatically.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## How the System Works
1. Facts are added to the knowledge base.
2. Rules are defined using IF–THEN logic.
3. The inference engine checks whether rule conditions are met.
4. If conditions are true, new facts are inferred and added.

## Example Logic Used
- Fact: *It is cold*
- Rule: IF it is cold THEN people wear jackets
- Inferred Result: *People wear jackets*

## Files in This Repository
- `kbs.ipynb` – Contains the Knowledge-Based System implementation and outputs
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## How to Run
1. Open `kbs.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook 
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. View inferred facts in the output cells
